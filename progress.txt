# Progress Log - direct-nlopt-rs: NLOPT DIRECT algorithm family in Rust


## Iteration 0 — Project Setup & Ralph Initialization (2026-02-21)

### What was implemented
- Initialized git repository in `direct-nlopt-rs/` with basic Rust project structure
- Created feature branch `feature/nlopt-direct-faithful-implementation` for all ralph-driven changes
- Created Cargo.toml with dependencies: rayon, parking_lot, thiserror, ordered-float, libc, etc.
- Created src/lib.rs crate root with module declarations
- Created src/error.rs with DirectReturnCode and DirectError types matching NLOPT's direct_return_code enum
- Created benches/benchmarks.rs placeholder for Criterion benchmarks
- Created .gitignore
- Thoroughly analyzed both NLOPT DIRECT implementations:
  - Gablonsky Fortran→C translation (DIRect.c, DIRsubrout.c, DIRserial.c, direct_wrap.c): ~2600 lines
  - SGJ C re-implementation (cdirect.c, hybrid.c): ~950 lines
- Generated permanent context prompt (prompts/direct-nlopt-rs.txt) with full project context,
  NLOPT C → Rust function mapping tables for both implementations, data structure correspondence,
  algorithm flow documentation, parallelization strategy, and task instructions
- Generated PRD plan (plans/prd-direct-nlopt.json) with 54 ordered tasks across 12 categories:
  analysis (5), implementation (10), test-foundation (1), test-unit (7), test-integration (11),
  parallelization (4), performance (3), ffi (1), edge-cases (3), test-regression (3), documentation (2)
- Verified Rust project builds successfully

### Files created
- direct-nlopt-rs/.gitignore
- direct-nlopt-rs/Cargo.toml
- direct-nlopt-rs/src/lib.rs
- direct-nlopt-rs/src/error.rs
- direct-nlopt-rs/benches/benchmarks.rs
- prompts/direct-nlopt-rs.txt (permanent context prompt for ralph)
- plans/prd-direct-nlopt.json (54-item PRD plan)

### Git commits
- `df12538` chore(init): initialize direct-nlopt-rs project with basic structure

### Test results
- Project builds successfully (cargo build)
- No tests yet (baseline)

### Notes
- Two NLOPT DIRECT codepaths must be ported: Gablonsky translation AND SGJ re-implementation
- The Gablonsky translation uses SoA + linked lists (similar to scipy port in direct-rs/)
- The SGJ re-implementation uses red-black trees (cleaner but different data structure)
- Both codepaths must produce identical results to their NLOPT C counterparts
- Parallelization via rayon should be added at function evaluation points
- The venv/ folder has Python 3.12 for any comparison scripts needed


## Iteration 1 — Analysis of DIRect.c Main Loop and Memory Layout (2026-02-21)

### What was implemented
- Thoroughly analyzed `nlopt/src/algs/direct/DIRect.c` line by line, documenting:
  - Complete `direct_direct_()` function: signature, all parameters, return codes
  - Full variable map: every dynamically allocated array (`c__`, `f`, `length`, `point`,
    `anchor`, `s`, `thirds`, `levels`, `w`, `oldl`, `oldu`, `list2`, `arrayi`) with sizes,
    indexing conventions (1-based Fortran heritage), and purpose
  - All scalar variables: `jones`, `ifree`, `minpos`, `fmax`, `numfunc`, `actdeep`,
    `actmaxdeep`, `maxi`, `maxpos`, `ifeasiblef`, `iinfesiblef`, `iepschange`, etc.
  - Memory allocation scheme: `MAXFUNC = maxf + 1000 + maxf/2`, `MAXDEEP = MAXFUNC/5`,
    `MAXDIV = 5000` constant
  - SGJ's transposition of arrays from Fortran column-major to C row-major layout
  - Initialization sequence: `dirheader_()` → `dirinitlist_()` → `dirpreprc_()` → `dirinit_()`
  - Main iteration loop: `dirchoose_()` → `dirdoubleinsert_()` (Original only) →
    for-each-selected-rect: remove → `dirget_i_()` → `dirsamplepoints_()` →
    `dirsamplef_()` → `dirdivide_()` → `dirinsertlist_()`
  - Termination checks in exact order: volume_tol → sigma_tol → fglobal → replace_inf →
    epsilon update → budget increase → maxfeval
  - Epsilon update logic: fixed when eps>0 (`iepschange=0`), Jones formula when eps<0
    (`iepschange=1`, `eps = max(|minf|*1e-4, epsfix)`)
  - Key quirks: bounds modified in-place by `dirpreprc_()`, volume check uses jones=0,
    budget elasticity for infeasible problems, MAXDIV=5000 limitation
- Created detailed pseudocode control flow diagram

### Files created
- direct-nlopt-rs/analysis/gablonsky_analysis.md

### Files modified
- plans/prd-direct-nlopt.json (marked first analysis item as passes: true)

### Git commits
- `ad0897f` docs(analysis): analyze DIRect.c main loop, memory layout, and control flow

### Test results
- N/A (analysis-only task, no code changes)

### Notes
- The 1-based indexing permeates the entire codebase and must be carefully handled in Rust
- `l` and `u` arrays are destructively overwritten by `dirpreprc_()` — Rust impl should
  store scaling coefficients separately to avoid this confusing pattern
- Volume tolerance check always uses jones=0 regardless of algorithm — potential intentional
  design or bug; Rust impl should match this exactly for faithfulness
- The `s` array (selected rectangles) has a hardcoded limit of MAXDIV=5000 — only relevant
  for DIRECT_ORIGINAL with `dirdoubleinsert_()`
